# TAO Pre-trained Detection Models

NVIDIA's [TAO Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/tao-toolkit) includes highly-accurate high-resolution object detection models, optimized/pruned and quantized for INT8 precision.  jetson-inference supports for TAO models that are based on the [DetectNet_v2](https://docs.nvidia.com/tao/tao-toolkit/text/object_detection/detectnet_v2.html) DNN architecture, including the following pre-trained models that are available:

* [PeopleNet](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/models/peoplenet)
* [DashCamNet](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/models/dashcamnet)
* [TrafficCamNet](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/models/trafficcamnet)
* [FaceDetect](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/models/facenet)

Although a section below covers how to convert and load your own DetectNet_v2 model that you trained or fine-tuned with TAO, let's take a look at using the pre-trained models first.

### PeopleNet

PeopleNet is a high-resolution 960x544 model with up to ~90% accuracy for detecting people, bags, and faces.  It's based on DetectNet_v2 with a ResNet-34 backbone & feature extractor.  Running detectnet/detectnet.py with `--model=peoplenet` will download, convert, and run the TAO PeopleNet model with INT8 precision on platforms that support it (and with FP16 otherwise).

# C++
$ ./detectnet --model=peoplenet pedestrians.mp4 pedestrians_peoplenet.mp4

# Python
$ ./detectnet.py --model=peoplenet pedestrians.mp4 pedestrians_peoplenet.mp4
```

There's also the `peoplenet-pruned` model ([`peoplenet_pruned_quantized_v2.3.2](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/models/peoplenet/files?version=pruned_quantized_v2.3.2) which is faster and slightly less accurate.
